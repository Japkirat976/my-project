Javascript:
variables are defined to access the svg canvas and the clear button
two variables isDrawing and currentPath are used to check when drawing starts and which path is being drawn
function getPoint(evt) calculates the exact x and y position of the mouse relative to the svg
when mousedown event happens -> drawing starts, a new path is created and stroke properties are set (color, width, no fill) then added to the svg
when mousemove happens -> if drawing is active, new line coordinates are added to the path so it follows the mouse
function finishDrawing() ends the drawing when mouse is released or leaves the svg
mouseup and mouseleave events call this function to stop drawing
clearBtn click event removes all the child elements of the svg to clear the canvas
