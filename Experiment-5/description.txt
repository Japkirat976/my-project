Tag: <div> with class product-list
this is the main container that holds all the products together

Tag: <div> with class product

inside it the product name is written (like Tshirt, Smartphone etc.)
data-category attribute is given to each product so that it can be checked in javascript and filtered accordingly

Javascript:
first a variable is defined to get the dropdown using getElementById
then all the products are selected using querySelectorAll

function productFilter() is created to check the selected category
inside it each product’s data-category attribute is compared with the selected value
if category is “all” or it matches the product’s category, then the product is shown (display = block)
otherwise it is hidden (display = none)

finally, addEventListener is used on the dropdown so that whenever the value changes the function is called to filter the products
